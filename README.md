# KAPINE
Kircular Accelerator Prototype Innovative New Experience

# Setup

## KiCAD Library Setup
Run the following command to install the third party KiCAD libraries used in the project

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

This project uses components from [digikey-kicad-library](https://github.com/Digi-Key/digikey-kicad-library) which is configured as a git submodule of this project. Git doesn't clone submodules of a project by default when the project it is cloned so this has to be done manually.


# Hardware

* m[0..15] -- Electromagnet control signals
* s[0..15] -- Photogate sensor input signals
* Debug 1 -- Debug led 1

### Change Log
* 2021-08-07: STM32F3 maps GPIO to EXTI interrupts based on pin number. The following changes needed to be made to support interrupts on all sensor input pins:
  * m11 (PA3 -> PA4)
  * s2 (PC10 -> PA3)
  * s12 (PC2 -> PA5)
  * s10 (PC4 -> PC14)
